# Algorithms implemented in Rust

## Overview
This is a repository implemented in Rust for various fundamental algorithms and data structures, intended for learning and recording purposes. It is licensed under the GPLv3 and is designed to be modular, making it easy to import into other code.

## Features
- Only use stable Rust
- Use Unsafe features only in certain data structures
- Includes integration tests
- Includes documents

## Usage
You need to install Rust, and then run the following commands.

To perform integration tests:

```shell
cargo test
```

To view the documentation:

```shell
cargo doc --open
```
